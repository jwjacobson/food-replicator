# food-replicator
Coding Temple Weekend Project #2
***

This is my second weekend project for the Coding Temple. The assignment was to make a shopping cart program using **Python**.

It is the largest and most complicated program I've written to date.

The title, *Food Replicator*, refers to my original conception of the program, which had the user using a replicator that was actually free, but running software to emulate a scarcity-era shopping experience. While working on it, I decided that was too much narrative complexity to convey by means of such a simple interface, so I changed it to a *Food Repository* accessed through a remote interface.

The choice of foods available is meant to imply a post-civilizational-collapse setting.
